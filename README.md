Pricing table WP plugin

## What is that?
It's a WordPress plugin that lets you build princing tables. One of the many out there.

## Ok, but... why?
Because I needed a pricing table plugin with a feature others do not have, namely shortcode processing inside tables fields. I couldn't find any other pricing table plugin with that feature, be it free or premium.

## How much does it cost?
It's free as in free speech AND as in free beer. No premium versions, all it does is there for free.
